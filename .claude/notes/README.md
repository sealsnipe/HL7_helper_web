# Claude Notes

This folder contains brainstorming notes, thoughts, and ideas captured during development of the HL7 Helper Web project.

## Purpose

These notes are **not** action items or plans. They are exploratory thoughts meant to:
- Capture ideas before they're forgotten
- Document considerations for future decisions
- Provide context for architectural choices
- Spark discussion and refinement

## How to Use These Notes

1. **Before implementing**: Check relevant notes for context
2. **During planning**: Reference ideas and trade-offs discussed
3. **After implementing**: Update notes with what we learned
4. **During reviews**: Verify notes are still accurate

## Contributing

When adding thoughts:
- Use markdown headers for organization
- Include pros/cons where applicable
- Add questions that need answers
- Date significant updates
- Keep it exploratory, not prescriptive
